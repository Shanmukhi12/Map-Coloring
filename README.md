# Map-Coloring
This project aims to calculate the chromatic number of the maps of the USA and Australia, solving the Map Coloring Problem. The objective is to assign colors to regions on the map so that no adjacent regions share the same color. Various techniques and heuristics are applied to optimize the color assignment process.
